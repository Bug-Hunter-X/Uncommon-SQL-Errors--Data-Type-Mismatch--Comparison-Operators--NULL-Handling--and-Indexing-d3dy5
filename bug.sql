In SQL, a common error is using the wrong data type for a column.  For example, trying to store a large number in a small integer field can lead to data truncation or unexpected results.  Another issue is using incorrect comparison operators, such as using `=` instead of `LIKE` when comparing strings with wildcards.  Improper handling of NULL values can also lead to unexpected results in queries and calculations.  Finally, insufficient indexing on frequently queried columns can drastically reduce query performance.
